#### Overview of the analysis

#### Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
In this deliverable the data in the "tripduration" column is converted to a datetime datatype and has the correct time format and DataFrame is exported as a new file without the index column.

#### Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Using Tableau, we created visualizations that shows:
- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

- There is a line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users, and the graph can be filtered by the hour.
- There is a line graph displaying the number of bikes that are checked out by duration for each gender by the hour, and the graph can be filtered by the hour and gender.
- A heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips for each hour of each day of the week.
- A heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week, and the heatmap can be filtered by gender.
- A heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, and you can only filter by user and gender.

#### Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

#### Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

#### Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
